Research Fields: Graph Neural Netowrk, Social Event Detection

I joined the School of Computing, Macquarie University, as a M.Res student candidate in 2022, supervised by A/Prof. [Jia Wu](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~jiawu/) and Prof. [Jian Yang](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~jian/). My research topics focus on GNN and social event detection. In 2024, I will continue my current research topics by moving ahead to Ph.D. journey at MQ. What a delightful and lucky experience it is to conduct research with productivity and efficiency in such a comfortable, quiet, and pleasant environment.

Before this, I've got an Master of Philosophy degree on information science, supervised by Prof. Hongqi HAN, from Intelligence Theory and Method Center, Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China(ISTIC) in 2018. <cr>
